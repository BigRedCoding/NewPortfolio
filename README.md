# PROJECT NAME: WEATHER AND MORE!

##

### **`DESCRIPTION:`**

### This is frontend of the WTWR weather application designed by Brandon Dooley. Users can find a summary of their local weather information and get recommendations as to what items they should wear. Users can create their own accounts, add/delete their own items, view other user's items, and like whichever items they want. This site is mobile friendly.

================================================================================================

### **`TECHNIQUES AND TECHNOLOGIES:`**

### The frontend of this application was created using various languages and add-ons including HTML, CSS, Javascript, and React.JS. The backend was created utilizing Node.js, EspressJS, MongoDB, Nginx, and Ubuntu. The project references a [weather](https://openweathermap.org/) website to gather information based on the user's current location (something I added personally). The server is hosted on Google and the URL is a free public domain through[https://freedns.afraid.org/](https://freedns.afraid.org/).

================================================================================================

### **`DEPLOYMENT:`**

### The website now is connected with a proper url at [https://www.bdwtwr.justlearning.net/](https://www.bdwtwr.justlearning.net/) or [http://www.bdwtwr.justlearning.net/](http://www.bdwtwr.justlearning.net/).

### The frontend repository is [here](https://bigredcoding.github.io/se_project_react/).

### The backend repository is [here](https://github.com/BigRedCoding/se_project_express).

### **`Video Demonstration:`**

### For the moment, I will wait on this until the project is accepted as complete by the reviewer.
