# PROJECT NAME: WEATHER AND MORE!

##

### **`DESCRIPTION:`**

### This is the beginning of a weather app designed to suggest clothing items based on the current weather! The functionality so far is limited, but users will eventually be able to add their own clothing and have their own account.

================================================================================================

### **`TECHNIQUES AND TECHNOLOGIES:`**

### This application was created using various languages including HTML, CSS, Javascript, and React.JS with an emphasis on React.JS as this project is to highlight its features. So far, the project references a [weather](https://openweathermap.org/) website to gather information based on the user's current location (something I added personally).

================================================================================================

### **`DEPLOYMENT:`**

### This website is desployed on GitHub at the following link: [here](https://bigredcoding.github.io/se_project_react/)

### I have recently updated this site to be reliant on a custom backend server I've created. In this project's "api.js", there is a variable called "baseUrl" and it is set to a local address that is targeted when the server is ran with the command "npm run dev." You can find this custom server at the following link: [here](https://github.com/BigRedCoding/se_project_express)

### **`Video Demonstration:`**

### For the moment, I will wait on this until the project is complete.
