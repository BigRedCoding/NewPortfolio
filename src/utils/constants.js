      "This employment is definitely the best testament to my current level of professionalism and maturity. There were a lot of factors as to why this happened, but the decision to earn my CDL prior and the sequence of events therein created the chance of experiencing this opportunity. And despite the fact that I had left this company, I will forever be grateful for everything.",
      "I started July 9th, 2019. This was less than a month after I married my wonderful wife. The company CRST had sponsored my CDL education, but decided to fire me when I wouldn't answer the phone during my wedding. Considering how hectic their program was prior, I thought it wise to take the opportunity they gave me and find another company. I was fortunate that Coeur d'Alene Window was expanding their operations and needed a driver.",
      "Five and a half years allowed me several varieties of challenging experiences. I was also able to travel to several states and meet several interesting people. Every week it seemed there was something new I was learning or doing. I was also fortunate enough to train several new employees. This further helped me hone my craft, better understand how to troubleshoot problems, and find appropriate solutions that I could explain in a way others could understand.",
      "Probably the number one lesson I learned with this company is the importance of communication. This particular issue created many interesting and challenging circumstances. I definitely had opportunities to practice troubleshooting issues, creating delivery game-plans, determining routing, analyzing costs, and other concerns that revolve around good common sense business practices somehow lost through failed communication. Regardless, the experiences made me much more independent and proactive, learning to expect the unexpected and creating processes that helped prevent negative consequences of most of the problems.",

      "Retail work lost its appeal, particularly since I was pushed into stocking shelves and had a part-time schedule. I wanted a more challenging environment with more potential for advancement. This led me to McDonald's.",
      "In comparison to Staples, McDonald's was much more fast-paced. There were plenty of tasks that I could focus on depending on what position I was for the day. That was the other aspect that was appealing: they moved me around. They weren't afraid to let me learn other positions. In fact, McDonald's was on track to have me open the store.",
      "Although this experience ended in a short time-frame, it was the most intense and fulfilling work opportunity I had up to that time in my history. It was the first time I was able to see what it takes to actually run a business, and I still feel inspired to this day to start a restaurant once the finances allow it. It also triggered instant memorization and progressive inference, allowing me to act more and more quickly and accurately.",

      "College was an interesting time for me. Although I was pushing for three Bachelors, I also allowed myself to be manipulated through peer pressure. It made life harder on myself, part of which included maintaining employment with companies. But even so, I still tried to push myself towards success. Staples was an excellent example of this.",
      "This position was mainly cashiering. They would also have me help with stocking shelves and assisting customers on the floor. Sometimes I would help out the tech and copy departments depending. All in all, I would tend to float wherever I was needed if able. There was a time when I was considered for advancement; I would be the inventory manager. They had me take part in re-models of stores, have me practice with their software interfaces and processes, and all around get a taste of running the store.",
      "Unfortunately, there were certain events that acted against that objective. These events made it where they wouldn't even have me as a cashier; I would just simply stock shelves. Now, there wasn't anything I did intentionally, but nevertheless the accumulation of events just made my future there ultimately dead. After I realized that, I searched for other work, which led me to McDonald's.",
