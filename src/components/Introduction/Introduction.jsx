          My name is Brandon Dooley. I want to thank you personally for taking
          time out of your day to view this website portfolio I created. My hope
          is this will demonstrate my commercial value effectively and
          efficiently so that you feel compelled to extend me an offer of
          employment.

        <p className="introduction__text">
          My current career is with The Coeur d'Alene Window Company as a Class
          A CDL Delivery Driver. This entails several functions, but mainly
          consists of a standard route that takes me through Montana and
          Wyoming. I am married, renting a beautiful home, have a little
          fur-baby, go to church, and spend time with the family (though, no
          kids at the moment). My younger years were both a little hectic and
          successful, but nowadays I am very much focused on pushing proactive
          objectives and keeping to my word.

          Driving as I do now has forced me to be away from home consistently
          for the last 5 Â½ years. Mixed with the dangers associated with
          weather, traffic, and heavy machinery, I felt it was time to move on
          and pursue something more reflective of my intelligence. This led me
          to TripleTen and their Software Engineering program.

          Starting October 1st, 2024, I proactively and passionately began to
          spend my free time and energy learning and working their boot-camp.
          Although I had played around with visual coding with Unreal Engine,
          this was the first that I hyper-focused on the physical coding lines
          with a clear curriculum. Not only has this program pushed modern
          objectives and methodologies, but their lessons also direct me into
          various tools to network effectively with real companies.

          Here is my efforts accumulated and summarized, perpetually improving.
          I will continue to update this site as I upgrade myself. May this
          endeavor be favorable.
